## 🎯 **Documentation Philosophy**

### ✅ **Keep Only**

- **📚 How-to guides** that teach programmers how to use features
- **🔧 Setup instructions** for essential services
- **⭐ Best practices** for consistent development
- **📖 Reference documentation** for core systems

### ❌ **Remove**

- **🔧 Fix documentation** that just describes what was broken
- **📝 Change logs** that document what was modified
- **⏰ Temporary solutions** that are no longer relevant
- **🔄 Redundant information** that's covered elsewhere

## 📝 **Documentation Standards**

### **✅ Required for New Guides**

- **📋 Clear, descriptive title** that explains the purpose
- **💻 Practical examples with code** that developers can copy-paste
- **📋 Step-by-step instructions** for implementation
- **⭐ Best practices and tips** for optimal usage
- **🎯 When and why to use** the feature

### **❌ Avoid in Documentation**

- **🔧 Fix summaries** - focus on how to use, not what was fixed
- **📝 Change logs** - document functionality, not history
- **⏰ Temporary solutions** - only permanent, working solutions
- **🔄 Redundant information** - avoid duplication
- **📚 Historical context** - focus on current usage

## 🔄 **Adding New Documentation**

Before creating new documentation, ask yourself:

| Question                                                    | ✅ Keep | ❌ Remove |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | --------- |
| **Is this a "how-to" guide?**                               | Yes     | No        |
| **Is this just documenting what was fixed?**                | No      | Yes       |
| **Will this help other programmers use the system?**        | Yes     | No        |
| **Is this just a change log or fix summary?**               | No      | Yes       |
| **Does this provide setup instructions or best practices?** | Yes     | No        |
